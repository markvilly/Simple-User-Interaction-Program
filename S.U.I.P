#Simple User Interaction Program

game_list = ['0','1','2']

#1. define function that will display the list of items to be replaced by the user.
def display_game(game_list):
    print("Here is your current list: ")
    print(game_list)


#2. define function that will accept user choice and store it as an integer(we'll use it later).
def position_choice():
    choice = 'Wrong'

    while choice not in ['0','1','2']:
        choice = input('Pick an index position (0,1,2): ')

        if choice not in ['0','1','2']:
            print('Sorry, invalid choice my love!')
    return int(choice)

#3. define function that will replace the string of the selected index.

def replacement_choice(game_list, position):
     
     string_replacement = input('Type in the string you want to replace at position: ')

     game_list[position] = string_replacement

     return game_list

#4. Define function that will prompt to keep the game going in a loop or not.

def gameon_choice():
    choice = 'Wrong'
    yesORno = ['y','n']

    while choice not in yesORno:
        choice = input('Keep going? (Y or N): ')

        if choice not in yesORno:
            print('Sorry me not understand! Pick Y or N!!!')
    
    if choice == 'y':
        return True
    else:
        return False
